The tool works a bit differently on this branch but will speed things up significantly when creating dex images. Follow the instructions below.

1. Copy the "pokemon" folder from pokeemerald-expansion/graphics/pokemon and paste it into the PokedexMaker directory (this will take some time)
2. In the PokedexMaker directory, run "python3 pokedexmaker.py"

Your images will be created in the "capdex" folder, with file name using the dex number and the Pokemon's name, separated by an underscore (ex. 001_maplage.png)
